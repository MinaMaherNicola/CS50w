# CS50w
All projects I made for Harvard's CS50 Web Programming with Python and Javascript.

Project 0: Just a simple responsive website of music shop because I've always wanted to have a career in music.

Project 1: In this project, I built a book review website. Users will be able to register for the website and then log in using their username and password. Once they log in, they will be able to search for books, leave reviews for individual books, and see the reviews made by other people. I also used a third-party API by Goodreads, another book review website, to pull in ratings from a broader audience. Finally, users will be able to query for book details and book reviews programmatically via your website’s API.

Project 2: In this project, I built an online messaging service using Flask, similar in spirit to Slack. Users will be able to sign into the site with a display name, create channels (i.e. chatrooms) to communicate in, as well as see and join existing channels. Once a channel is selected, users will be able to send and receive messages with one another in real time. Finally, users are able to delete their chatrooms and messages.

Project 3: In this project, I built a web application for handling a pizza restaurant’s online orders. Users will be able to browse the restaurant’s menu, add items to their cart, and submit their orders. Meanwhile, the restaurant owners will be able to add and update menu items, and view orders that have been placed.

Project 4: The purpose of the website is to help the individual to manage and keep track of incomes and expenses.
